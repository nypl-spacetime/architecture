    <h1>NYC Space/Time Directory - Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      This diagram shows the <i>current state</i> of the evolving technical architecture of the <a href="http://spacetime.nypl.org">NYC Space/Time Directory</a> project, currently in development by <a href="http://labs.nypl.org">NYPL Labs</a>.
      The diagram shows how tools and components work together, and how they share data. It does not show the final state of the project â€” new blocks will be added as the project
      procedes and work is started on new datasets, data processing tools and user interfaces. Parts of the Space/Time Directory are based on <a href="http://histograph.io">Histograph</a>,
      a search engine for historical place names built by <a href="http://waag.org">Waag Society</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this diagram, only code and data components of the Space/Time Directory project are shown. Other, and equally important parts of the project (e.g. outreach, meetups, hackathons, collaborations),
      are (currently) not shown in this diagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finished components are <span class='legend-block finished-color5'>green</span>, components on which work has not started are <span class='legend-block finished-color1'>white</span>,
      and components on which we are currently working are shaded green according to their finished state. External, non-Space/Time components are white with
      a <span class='legend-block legend-block-external finished-color0'>dashed</span> line. For components with associated GitHub repositories, the number of open issues
      are shown in the <span class='legend-badge'>red</span> badges.

      This architecture diagram itself can be <a href="https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/architecture">found on
      GitHub</a> too. Please <a href="https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/architecture/issues">open an issue</a> if
      the diagram is incorrect or out of date. And it's easy to <a href="https://github.com/nypl-spacetime/architecture/blob/gh-pages/README.md">make a similar diagram</a> for your own project!
